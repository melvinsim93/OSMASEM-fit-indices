# Meta-Analytic Structural Equation Modelling (MASEM) is a novel approach that combines meta-analysis and SEM together. It enables researchers to take a whole model approach in testing meta-analysed effects while also allowing the hypothesized model to be tested for its fit to the observed pooled data. Current MASEM methods are disadvantaged as they are not able to evaluate both categorical and continuous moderators or suffer a loss of statistical power due to small sample sizes. In contrast, the one-Step MASEM (OSMASEM) proposed by Jak and Cheung (2019) is a promising novel approach to MASEM accounts for these flaws. Thus far, initial simulations are promising (Jak & Cheung, 2019). However, it is not yet clear how SEM fit indices perform under OSMASEM. Thus, to supplement initial findings, the present thesis conducted a series of simulations to test the performance of fit indices for OSMASEM under differing conditions of heterogeneity, model misspecification, model size, sample size, study size and missingness.
